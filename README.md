## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural
hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their
scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its
processes.

This web application is designed to visualize all earthquakes recorded by the USGS for the past 30 days.
